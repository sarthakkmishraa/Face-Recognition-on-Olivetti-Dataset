# Face-Recognition-on-Olivetti-Dataset

In this study, face recognition was performed using the face images in the Olivetti data set. The steps for face recognition are as follows:

           (i)   Principal components of face images were obtained by PCA.
           (ii)  Adequate number of principal components determined
           (iii) According to three different classification models, accuracy score obtained.
           (iv)  According to three different classification models, cross-validation accuracy score were obtained.
           (v)   Parameter optimization of the best model has been made.

Brief information about Olivetti Dataset:

            Face images taken between April 1992 and April 1994.
            There are ten different image of each of 40 distinct people
            There are 400 face images in the dataset
            Face images were taken at different times, variying ligthing, facial express and facial detail
            All face images have black background
            The images are gray level
            Size of each image is 64x64 
            Image pixel values were scaled to [0, 1] interval
            Names of 40 people were encoded to an integer from 0 to 39
